Dependently-typed structures for quantum physics in Idris

This is a set of Idris libraries I'm developing for a variety of applications related to quantum physics. Most of them are directly relevant for the main program (in development) that's intended to perform basic simulations and calcuations of quantum systems, both infinite and finite-dimensional.

This code may require Idris 0.9.16 or current HEAD.
